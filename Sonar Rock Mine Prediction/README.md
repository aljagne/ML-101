## Summary of the Project
This project is dedicated to the basics of **logistic Regression model** in machine learning. This notebook looks over a proper machine learning workflow like exploring the data
and finding patterns within the data.

Then we'll use Logistic Regression to classify if sonar detected a rock or a mine.

## For Practise

You should try using different algorithms to obtain better results, this will enhance your understanding about machine learning concepts more!
